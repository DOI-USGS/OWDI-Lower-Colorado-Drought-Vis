				<p>Approximately 1,400 miles long, flowing through seven states and Mexico, the Colorado River drains roughly one-twelfth of the land area of the contiguous United States.  The Colorado River Basin is divided into Upper and Lower Basins at the Lee Ferry compact point located in northern Arizona. The Upper Basin spans portions of Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and northern Arizona, and the Lower Basin spans portions of Nevada, Arizona, California, and western New Mexico. The Colorado River also supplies water to portions of northwestern Mexico, in the states of Baja California and Sonora, and serves at least 22 Federally-recognized Native American Tribes and Communities located within the Basin.</p>

				<!--<img src="../img/3dbasins.jpg" alt="lower and upper colorado basins in 3D"/>-->
		
		        <p> The Upper Colorado River Basin supplies most of the water for the Basin. Of the total water supply from the Upper Basin, about 50 percent of streamflow comes from baseflow (Rumsey et al., 2015). Most baseflow is water that originates as precipitation and snowmelt in the Rocky and Wasatch Mountains, replenishes local groundwater supplies, and resurfaces as streamflow that feeds Upper Basin reservoirs. The Lower Basin is arid with little tributary runoff reaching the mainstream of the Colorado River except during occasional rain events.  The Lower Basin is dependent upon managed use of the Colorado River system to make its land habitable and productive.  The importance of the Colorado River to the region it serves is underscored by the legal framework that governs its management.</p>
		        
				<div id="basinDividedHiddenContent" class="hiddenContent">
		        <p> Within the Basin is an interconnected system of rivers, dams, reservoirs, and water diversions that provides water for uses such as agriculture, municipal and domestic use, hydropower, ecosystems, and recreation. Colorado River water is also delivered to areas that lie outside the Basin's hydrologic boundary, including southwestern California, the east side of the Front Range in Colorado, and the west side of the Wasatch Range in Utah.</p>
		        
		        <p>Resources and facilities within the Colorado River Basin are managed to accomplish their project goals in a manner fully consistent with applicable provisions of Federal law including the <a href="http://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/pao/lawofrvr.html" target="_blank">Law of the River</a> and other project-specific operational guidelines. The Law of the River includes operating criteria, regulations, administrative decisions, Federal statutes, interstate compacts, court decisions and decrees, an international treaty, and contracts with the Secretary, and defines the responsibilities of the Secretary's water master role in the Lower Basin.</p>

		        <p>The natural water supply of the Basin is highly variable from year-to-year. The ability to capture water during high flow years and to use this stored water in drier years has enabled Reclamation to meet resource needs throughout this drought period. Although the Basin is experiencing the worst 16-year drought in over 100 years of record, the system of reservoirs has provided multiple years of storage as designed and, throughout the drought, delivery commitments in both basins have been met.</p>
		        
				<div id="blueDragonHiddenContent" class="hiddenContent">
		        
		        <p>In the Lower Basin, Hoover Dam was constructed pursuant to the 1928 Boulder Canyon Project Act (BCPA) for the purpose of controlling floods, improving navigation, regulating the river's flow, providing for water storage and delivery, and for the generation of electrical energy. The BCPA and subsequent construction of Hoover Dam in 1935 allowed for the construction of the Imperial Diversion Dam in 1938, the last diversion dam on the Colorado River for United States water users located north of Yuma, Arizona. From its head works, water is diverted into the All-American Canal on the California side of the dam and into the Gila Gravity Main Canal on the Arizona side of the dam. These diversions provide water to the Gila Project, the Yuma Project, the Imperial Irrigation District, the Coachella Valley Water District, and the City of Yuma, and through Siphon Drop and Pilot Knob to the Northerly International Boundary (NIB) for diversion at Morelos Dam in Mexico.</p>
		        
		        <p>In 1938, Parker Dam was constructed to regulate water released from Hoover Dam and allowed for the construction of the W.P. Whitsett Intake Pumping Plant in 1940 and the Mark Wilmer Pumping Plant in 1993 (water diversions for the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California and Central Arizona Project, respectively). The construction of Davis Dam in 1953 provided additional regulation for water released from Hoover Dam. Water released from both of these facilities are made to satisfy beneficial use requirements of Lower Colorado River entitlement holders in the United States, deliver water to Mexico pursuant to the 1944 U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty, and to generate hydropower with these water releases.</p>

		    <p>Approximately 90 percent of the Basin's water supply comes from the Upper Basin. As a result, drought conditions in the Upper Basin impact water supply and resources in both the Lower Basin and the Upper Basin. Long-term drought like the Basin has experienced since 2000 reflects natural climate variability coupled with the likely impacts from changing climate and increased temperature over the past two decades.</p>
		    
		    <p>The USGS stream gage at Lees Ferry, Arizona is the lowermost mainstream gage in the Upper Basin, located about 12 miles downstream of Glen Canyon Dam and about 1 mile upstream of the Compact Point between the Upper and Lower Basins. Natural flow at this gage location is used as a proxy for the hydrologic conditions in the Upper Basin and the overall hydrologic health of the Basin. Natural flow is defined as the streamflow that would have otherwise occurred without the effects of human activities such as reservoir regulation and depletion of water supply.</p>

		<p>Historical observations are extended by a <a href="{{baseUrl}}/treeringdata/index.html" target="_blank">tree-ring reconstruction</a> of streamflow going back approximately 1,200 years, as estimated by Meko et al. (2007). Because trees grow less during dry years and more during wet years, tree-ring cores can be used to estimate historical streamflow conditions going back many centuries. Tree-ring core samples were collected from locations throughout the Upper Basin to estimate historical natural flow. These estimates were validated using the observed natural flow record developed by Reclamation.</p>

				<p>Basin-wide system storage totals about 60 maf, approximately four times the average annual inflow in the Upper Basin (14.8 maf). The Basin's two largest reservoirs, Lake Powell and Lake Mead, combine for about 50 maf of storage, approximately 83 percent of the total system storage. This large storage capacity creates a buffer against year-to-year hydrologic variability and longer-term drought periods by allowing the storage of excess water during wet years and the use of water from storage during dry years.</p>
				<p>It is this large amount of Basin-wide storage that has allowed Reclamation to continue to meet water delivery requirements during the current drought period. It should be noted, however, that headwater reaches in the Upper Basin sometimes experience localized shortages due to insufficient in-stream flows during dry years.</p>

		      <p>Since the early 1900s, water demand in the Colorado River Basin has increased while water supply has, on average, decreased. For the 15-year period preceding the signing of the <a href="http://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g1000/pdfiles/crcompct.pdf" target="_blank">1922 Colorado River Compact</a>, when 7.5 maf was apportioned to both the Upper and Lower Basins, the average annual natural flow in the Upper Basin was about 18.0 maf. When the 1944 U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty was executed, the long-term average annual natural flow in the Upper Basin was about 16.3 maf. The current long-term average annual natural flow in the Upper Basin is about 14.8 maf (Bureau of Reclamation, 2015).</p>

		  	<p>Since 2001, Lake Mead's elevation dropped from 1,196 to 1,075 feet by June 2015 (a decline of 121 feet). As the upper photo slider shows, the decline in the reservoir elevation during this time has exposed a white band of mineralized rock around the shoreline. The declining reservoir level has also exposed Hoover Dam's four intake towers, two on the right side and two on the left side of the photo slider. Water from the reservoir flows through these intake towers at specified release volumes to meet downstream water demands in Arizona, California, Nevada, and Mexico, while producing hydropower as water flows through Hoover Dam's 17 hydroelectric turbines.</p>
			<p id="hideMe" class="hiddenContent">The lower photos show the conditions of Lake Mead and the upstream face of Hoover Dam in 2001 at elevation 1,196 feet (left photo) and the conditions in June 2015 at elevation 1,075 feet (center photo). The lower photos also show the Nevada spillway in the bottom right corner of the photos. There are two spillways at Hoover Dam, one on the Nevada side and one on the Arizona side of the dam. At higher reservoir levels, spillways would be use to bypass flow around the Hoover Dam powerplant to prevent water from overtopping the dam. When water reaches the top of the spillway drum gates, it flows into the spillways, bypassing the dam via a series of tunnels and re-entering the river channel below the dam.</p>
		  </div>
		  <div id="beforeAfter01HiddenContent" class="hiddenContent">
		  	<p>Every 1-foot drop in the elevation of Lake Mead reduces Hoover Dam's powerplant capacity by approximately 5.7 megawatts (Reclamation estimate, as reported in Illia, 2010).  Since Lake Mead was last full in 2000, Hoover Dam's powerplant capacity has fallen from 2,074 to 1,563 megawatts (as of August 2015). Reclamation has mitigated some of this impact by replacing traditional turbines with "wide-head" turbines, which are capable of generating more efficiently at lower reservoir levels, and making significant efficiency improvements to the powerplant (Kuckro, 2014).</p>
		  	<p>At Lake Powell, risk to the Glen Canyon Dam powerplant is related to declining reservoir levels and the potential for loss of generating capacity below elevation 3,490 feet. Based on Reclamation analysis conducted in August 2015, the earliest this is projected to occur is 2019 (about a 5 percent chance of occurring). Since Lake Powell finished filling in 1980, its water surface elevation has fallen to as low as elevation 3,555 feet (33 percent of capacity) in April 2005, approximately 65 feet above minimum power pool.</p>

		        <p>Since the drought began in 2000, Lake Mead's elevation has declined by nearly 140 feet, declining every year except for 2005 and 2011. Projections of Lake Mead elevations are made by Reclamation and summarized in the <a href="http://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g4000/24mo/index.html" target="_blank">Colorado River Basin 24-Month Study reports</a>. The 24-Month Study is Reclamation's monthly operations model, simulating 12 major reservoirs in the Colorado River Basin on a monthly time step for a period of 24 months. These include nine reservoirs in the Upper Basin (Fontenelle, Flaming Gorge, Taylor Park, Blue Mesa, Morrow Point, Crystal, Vallecito, Navajo, and Lake Powell) and three reservoirs in the Lower Basin (Lake Mead, Lake Mohave, and Lake Havasu). Model output is used for annual and monthly decision support for mid-term operations (looking out 1 to 2 years).</p>
				
		        <div id="lakeMeadHiddenContent" class="hiddenContent">
		        <p>The 24-Month Study utilizes forecasted Upper Basin inflow hydrology (provided by the <a href="http://www.cbrfc.noaa.gov/" target="_blank">Colorado Basin River Forecast Center</a>), projected reservoir operations, projected diversion and consumptive use schedules, and other factors, to generate a single scenario of potential reservoir conditions.</p>
		       
		       
		       <p>As Lake Mead's elevation declines, the Lower Basin comes closer to its first ever shortage condition. The annual operating conditions for Lake Mead and Lake Powell in the upcoming year are based on projected January 1 reservoir elevations from the August 24-Month Study consistent with the 2007 Record of Decision on Colorado River Interim Guidelines for Lower Basin Shortages and the Coordinated Operations for Lake Powell and Lake Mead (<a href="http://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/programs/strategies.html" target="_blank">2007 Interim Guidelines</a>). The January 1 projections and resulting annual operation for Lake Mead and Lake Powell are reported in the Annual Operating Plan for Colorado River Reservoirs (AOP) for the upcoming year. The <a href="http://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g4000/AOP2016/AOP16_draft.pdf" target="_blank">draft 2016 AOP</a>, the <a href="http://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g4000/aop/AOP15.pdf" target="_blank">2015 AOP</a>, and <a href="http://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g4000/aop/index.html" target="_blank">previous years' AOPs</a> can be found on Reclamation's website.</p>
		                
		        <p>In addition to impacting water supply, impacts of changing reservoir levels also extend to the aquatic ecosystem. Water level changes and natural disturbances, such as storm events and resulting local runoff, can re-suspend sediments. Because some Lake Mead sediments contain contaminants, re-suspension of sediment may be of concern to ecological health (<a href="http://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/1381/pdf/circ1381.pdf" target="_blank">U.S. Geological Survey, 2012</a>).</p>

		        <p>In the Colorado River Basin, Reclamation is collaborating with its stakeholders on a number of projects, including developing creative strategies to reduce the impacts of drought and increase reservoir storage at Lake Powell and Lake Mead. Activities related to drought response include a system conservation program and drought contingency planning efforts in both basins. Additional ongoing activities are being conducted with stakeholders through the Basin Study Moving Forward process and with Native American Tribes through the Ten Tribes Partnership Tribal Water Study. Lastly, the implementation of Minute 319 and related binational discussions also underscore the importance of the partnership and continued collaboration between the United States and Mexico.</p>

		        <h3></h3>
		        <p>In 2014, an $11 million funding agreement for <a href="http://www.usbr.gov/newsroom/newsrelease/detail.cfm?RecordID=48006" target="_blank">Pilot System Conservation Program (PSCP)</strong></a> was executed among Reclamation, Central Arizona Water Conservation District (CAWCD), the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD), Denver Water (DW), and the Southern Nevada Water Authority (SNWA) (the Funding Partners). The PSCP establishes a mechanism for funding the creation of Colorado River system water through voluntary water conservation actions and reductions in water use beginning in 2015 and continuing through at least 2016.  The purpose of the PSCP is to explore and learn about the effectiveness of voluntary measures that could be used, when needed, to help maintain water levels in Lake Powell and Lake Mead above critical levels.  All water conserved as a result of the pilot program would be considered Colorado River system water.  Proposals under the PSCP have been received from potential program participants in both the Upper and Lower Basins, where execution of implementation agreements began in 2015 and is ongoing.</p>
		
		        <h3></h3>
				<p>In Lower Basin drought contingency planning, Reclamation is working with Arizona, California, and Nevada to identify proactive steps to lower the risk of reaching critical elevations at Lake Mead.  A step forward was a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for <a href="http://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g4000/LB_DroughtResponseMOU.pdf" target="_blank">Pilot Drought Response Actions</strong></a> signed by Reclamation and several water agencies in the Lower Basin States in December 2014. The MOU outlines a commitment by the parties to use best efforts to generate between 1.5 and 3.0 maf of additional water in Lake Mead through 2019.  Reclamation, MWD, SNWA, and CAWCD have agreed to take first steps to generate 0.740 maf of the additional water by the end of 2017. The MOU is an important step forward but a more comprehensive drought plan is currently being discussed with key water agencies in the Lower Basin.</p>
		
		        <p>In Upper Basin drought contingency planning, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming are pursuing a plan with three major components: 1) extended operations of the Colorado River Storage Project (CRSP) reservoirs, 2) voluntary demand management (e.g., fallowing or deficit irrigation), and 3) augmentation (primarily weather modification, such as cloud seeding).  Reclamation, in collaboration with the Upper Basin States, has conducted modeling that indicates extended operations of the upper CRSP reservoirs to move water to Lake Powell can significantly reduce the probability of Lake Powell falling below critical elevations.  Reclamation, in consultation with the Upper Basin States, is developing an extended operations plan and implementation agreement.  It is anticipated that these will be completed by the end of 2015.</p>
		
		        <p>In addition to the previously mentioned activities, Congress has provided authorization for additional funding through Reclamation for drought-related activities to increase Colorado River system water in Lake Mead, Lake Powell, and other Colorado River system reservoirs for the benefit of the system.  This authorization requires that a report evaluating the effectiveness of the water conservation pilot projects be submitted to Congress in 2018, including a recommendation on whether the activities undertaken by the pilot projects should be continued. (Per the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (Public Law 113-235, Div. D., Secs. 204-206), executed on December 16, 2014.)</p>
		
		        <h3></h3>
		        <p>In May 2013, Reclamation and Basin stakeholders initiated the Moving Forward effort to build on future considerations and next steps identified in the Colorado River Basin Study. The Moving Forward effort enhances the broad, inclusive stakeholder process demonstrated in the Basin Study with an ultimate goal of identifying actionable steps to address projected water supply and demand imbalances that have broad-based support and provide a wide range of benefits. The Moving Forward effort is being conducted in a phased approach. Phase 1 began with the formation of a Coordination Team and three multi-stakeholder workgroups that focus on water conservation, reuse and environmental and recreational flows. In May, 2015 the <a href="http://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/programs/crbstudy/MovingForward/Phase1Report.html" target="_blank"><strong>Phase 1 Report</strong></a> was published, which documents the activities and outcomes of the workgroups during this phase and includes opportunities for potential future action.</p>
		
		
		
		        <h3></h3>
		        <p>Begun in late 2013, the Colorado River Basin Ten Tribes Partnership Tribal Water Study is a cooperative effort with the Ten Tribes Partnership, whose members hold a significant amount of quantified and unquantified federal reserved water rights to the Colorado River and its tributaries. The study builds on the technical foundation of the Colorado River Basin Study by further assessing water supplies and demands for these tribes and identifies tribal opportunities and challenges associated with the development of tribal water. This study is anticipated to be completed in 2016.</p>
		
		        <h3></h3>
		        <p>In November 2012, the United States and Mexico reached agreement on <a href="http://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/feature/minute319.html" target="_blank">Minute 319</strong></a> to the 1944 U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty. Minute 319 is a five-year agreement (2013-2017) which provides for a series of joint cooperative actions between the United States and Mexico, including surplus sharing during higher Lake Mead conditions, reduced water deliveries during lower Lake Mead conditions, flexibility with the Intentionally Created Mexican Apportionment mechanism, opportunities for improved and more efficient infrastructure, and water for the environment. In 2014, pursuant to Section III.6.e.i of IBWC Minute No. 319, a <a href="http://www.ibwc.state.gov/Files/Minutes/Min319_Fact_Sheet.pdf" target="_blank">pulse flow</strong></a> of approximately 105,000 acre-feet was delivered to Mexico from March 23 through May 18 to benefit the riparian ecosystem in the Colorado River Delta. Implementation of the pulse flow also involved a <a href="http://www.ibwc.gov/EMD/Min319Monitoring.pdf" target="_blank">monitoring</strong></a> component conducted by scientists and experts from the United States and Mexico to determine the environmental benefits of the pulse flow and the overall performance of the pilot project. With the success of the binational implementation of this project, the United States and Mexico hope to develop a new binational agreement in the spirit of continued collaboration to meet future challenges ahead.</p>
