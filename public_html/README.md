public_html
===========

This is the HTML5 directory which will be copied to the server.  It should contain all the html, css, and javascript developed for this visualization.  Any data that is used as part of the visualization should be placed within the data directory.  This data is the processed output data, and source data and scripts can be left at the root level of this repository.

Further directory structure may need to be added to keep the repository organized, but this is a good starting point.
