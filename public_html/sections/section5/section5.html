        	<h1>When Water Use Exceeds Supply, Storage Reserves are Depleted</h1>
        	<h2>When water use exceeds supply, regional water storage decreases. Since the early 1900â€™s, water use has increased while water supply is, on average, decreasing. When water use is greater than supply, water storage is decreased, as can be seen in reduced levels in reservoirs in the Lower Colorado River basin. </h2>
