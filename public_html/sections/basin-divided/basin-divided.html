            The Colorado River basin is divided into upper and lower basins. The upper basin spans the states of Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah. The lower basin spans Nevada, Arizona and California. The River also supplies water to the northern portion of the country of Mexico.

            Precipitation, primarily in the form of snow, falls on the Rocky Mountains, melts and replenishes Colorado River basin reservoirs. Colorado River basin reservoirs provide water for both upper and lower basins. The lower Colorado River basin is much drier than the upper basin, thus depends on deliveries from the upper basin for most of its Colorado River water.

            The Colorado River system was nearly full at the start of the current drought (Lakes Powell and Mead were at about 95% full). Lake Meadâ€™s elevation has declined approximately 136 feet since the end of water year 1999. This is a decline from elevation 1,211 feet (369.1 meters) on September 30, 1999 to elevation 1,075 feet in June 2015.

            The first five years of the drought resulted in rapid decline in storage in Lakes Powell and Mead. Over the past 10 years, Lakes Powell and Mead storage has fluctuated between about 45 and 55% of capacity.During the drought, 3 years of above average natural flow (2005, 2008, and 2011) have been experienced.

            These years were critical to replenishing storage at Lakes Powell and Mead.
