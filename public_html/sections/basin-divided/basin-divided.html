		<p>Approximately 1,400 miles long, flowing through seven states and Mexico, the Colorado River drains roughly one-twelfth of the land area of the contiguous United States.  The Colorado River Basin is divided into Upper and Lower Basins at the Lee Ferry compact point located in northern Arizona. The Upper Basin spans portions of Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and northern Arizona, and the Lower Basin spans portions of Nevada, Arizona, California, and western New Mexico. The Colorado River also supplies water to portions of northwestern Mexico, in the states of Baja California and Sonora, and serves at least 22 Federally-recognized Native American Tribes and Communities located within the Basin.</p>

        <p> The Upper Colorado River Basin supplies most of the water for the Basin. Of the total water supply from the Upper Basin, about 50 percent of streamflow comes from baseflow (Rumsey et al., 2015). Most baseflow is water that originates as precipitation and snowmelt in the Rocky and Wasatch Mountains, replenishes local groundwater supplies, and resurfaces as streamflow that feeds Upper Basin reservoirs. The Lower Basin is arid with little tributary runoff reaching the mainstream of the Colorado River except during occasional rain events.  The Lower Basin is dependent upon managed use of the Colorado River system to make its land habitable and productive.  The importance of the Colorado River to the region it serves is underscored by the legal framework that governs its management.</p>
        
        <p> Within the Basin is an interconnected system of rivers, dams, reservoirs, and water diversions that provides water for uses such as agriculture, municipal and domestic use, hydropower, ecosystems, and recreation. Colorado River water is also delivered to areas that lie outside the Basin’s hydrologic boundary, including southwestern California, the east side of the Front Range in Colorado, and the west side of the Wasatch Range in Utah.</p>
        
        <p>Resources and facilities within the Colorado River Basin are managed to accomplish their project goals in a manner fully consistent with applicable provisions of Federal law including the <a href="http://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/pao/lawofrvr.html" target="_blank">Law of the River</a> and other project-specific operational guidelines. The Law of the River includes operating criteria, regulations, administrative decisions, Federal statutes, interstate compacts, court decisions and decrees, an international treaty, and contracts with the Secretary, and defines the responsibilities of the Secretary’s water master role in the Lower Basin.</p>
