		<p> Since 2000, the upper Colorado River basin has experienced the 15 driest years in the > 100 year historical record (Bureau of Reclamation), and one of the most severe droughts in the last 1200 years (Meko et al. 2012). </p>
        <p>90% of total basin water supply comes from upper Colorado River basin (Bureau of Reclamation). Of water supply from the upper basin, about 50% of streamflow comes from groundwater (Rumsey et al. 2015) </p>

			<p>Historical, natural flow at Lee’s Ferry, Arizona shows how streamflow decreases in response to drought. The plot above, the Bureau of Reclamation used USGS streamgage data to estimate the flow that would occur without human activities, also known as natural flow, at Lee’s Ferry. Lee’s Ferry is one of the uppermost observed stream gage locations in the Lower Colorado River Basin and is used as a proxy for water entering the Lower Basin via the Colorado River. Also shown is a tree-ring reconstruction of streamflow going back ~1200 years, estimated by Meko et al. (2012). Because trees grow less during drought, tree ring cores can be used to estimate the historical streamflow conditions going back many centuries. Tree ring samples were collected from many locations in the basin to estimate historical, natural flow; and were validated using observed streamflow data.
