        <p>The natural water supply of the Basin is highly variable from year-to-year. The ability to capture water during high flow years and to use this stored water in drier years has enabled Reclamation to meet resource needs throughout this drought period. Although the Basin is experiencing the worst 16-year drought in over 100 years of record, the system of reservoirs has provided multiple years of storage as designed and, throughout the drought, delivery commitments in both basins have been met.</p>

        <p>In addition to providing storage for regional water supply and facilitating water deliveries, the dams and reservoirs in the Colorado River system also provide flood control benefits, improve navigation, and allow for the generation of hydroelectric power. The construction of these facilities have allowed for the development adjacent or nearby water delivery systems and management supports ancillary benefits such as other economic, cultural, and ecologic services.</p>
        
        <p>In the Lower Basin, Hoover Dam was constructed pursuant to the 1928 Boulder Canyon Project Act (BCPA) for the purpose of controlling floods, improving navigation, regulating the riverâ€™s flow, providing for water storage and delivery, and for the generation of electrical energy. The BCPA and subsequent construction of Hoover Dam in 1935 allowed for the construction of the Imperial Diversion Dam in 1938, the last diversion dam on the Colorado River for United States water users located north of Yuma, Arizona. From its head works, water is diverted into the All-American Canal on the California side of the dam and into the Gila Gravity Main Canal on the Arizona side of the dam. These diversions provide water to the Gila Project, the Yuma Project, the Imperial Irrigation District, the Coachella Valley Water District, and the City of Yuma, and through Siphon Drop and Pilot Knob to the Northerly International Boundary (NIB) for diversion at Morelos Dam in Mexico. </p>
        
        <p> In 1938, Parker Dam was constructed to regulate water released from Hoover Dam and allowed for the construction of the W.P. Whitsett Intake Pumping Plant in 1940 and the Mark Wilmer Pumping Plant in 1993 (water diversions for the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California and Central Arizona Project, respectively). The construction of Davis Dam in 1953 provided additional regulation for water released from Hoover Dam. Water released from both of these facilities are made to satisfy beneficial use requirements of Lower Colorado River entitlement holders in the United States, deliver water to Mexico pursuant to the 1944 U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty, and to generate hydropower with these water releases.</p>
