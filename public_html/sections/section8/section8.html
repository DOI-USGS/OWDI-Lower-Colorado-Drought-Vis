    	<p>Since the early 1900’s, water use in the Colorado River basin has increased while water supply is, on average, decreasing. The storage capacity available on the Colorado River system has meant that we’ve been able to meet water demands during this sustained drought of the last 15 years. However, water use during the drought has exceeded supplies into the system, drawing down the stored reserves. </p>
