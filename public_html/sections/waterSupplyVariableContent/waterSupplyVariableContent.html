    <p>Approximately 90 percent of the Basin’s water supply comes from the Upper Basin. As a result, drought conditions in the Upper Basin impact water supply and resources in both the Lower Basin and the Upper Basin. Long-term drought like the Basin has experienced since 2000 reflects natural climate variability coupled with the likely impacts from changing climate and increased temperature over the past two decades. </p>
    
    <p>The USGS stream gage at Lees Ferry, Arizona is the lowermost mainstream gage in the Upper Basin, located about 12 miles downstream of Glen Canyon Dam and about 1 mile upstream of the Compact Point between the Upper and Lower Basins. Natural flow at this gage location is used as a proxy for the hydrologic conditions in the Upper Basin and the overall hydrologic health of the Basin. Natural flow is defined as the streamflow that would have otherwise occurred without the effects of human activities such as reservoir regulation and depletion of water supply.</p>

            <p>Here, 16-year average natural flow at Lees Ferry shows periods of below and above average flow. The most recent drought, 2000-2015 (indicated by brown bar) was the worst in the 20th century, and one of the worst 16-year periods in the last 1000 years. The early part of the 20th century was particularly wet (indicated by green bar), and corresponds to the period of reference used to set water allocations to states in the <a href="http://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g1000/pdfiles/crcompct.pdf" target="_blank">1922 Colorado River Compact</a>. At the time the 1922 Compact went into effect, the 16-year average annual inflow at Lees Ferry was approximately 18.0 MAF (Bureau of Reclamation, 2012).

<p>Historical observations are extended by a tree-ring reconstruction of streamflow going back approximately 1200 years, estimated by Meko et al. (2012). Because trees grow less during drought, tree ring cores can be used to estimate historical streamflow conditions going back many centuries. Tree ring samples were collected from locations throughout the Upper Basin to estimate historical, natural flow; and were validated using observed streamflow data.
