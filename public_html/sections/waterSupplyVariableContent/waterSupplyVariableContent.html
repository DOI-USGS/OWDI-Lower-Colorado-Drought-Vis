    <p>Approximately 90 percent of the Basin’s water supply comes from the Upper Basin. As a result, drought conditions in the Upper Basin impact water supply and resources in both the Lower Basin and the Upper Basin. Long-term drought like the Basin has experienced since 2000 reflects natural climate variability coupled with the likely impacts from changing climate and increased temperature over the past two decades. </p>
    
    <p>The USGS stream gage at Lees Ferry, Arizona is the lowermost mainstream gage in the Upper Basin, located about 12 miles downstream of Glen Canyon Dam and about 1 mile upstream of the Compact Point between the Upper and Lower Basins. Natural flow at this gage location is used as a proxy for the hydrologic conditions in the Upper Basin and the overall hydrologic health of the Basin. Natural flow is defined as the streamflow that would have otherwise occurred without the effects of human activities such as reservoir regulation and depletion of water supply.</p>

            <p>In the graphic above, the 10-year average <a href="http://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g4000/NaturalFlow/documentation.html">natural flow</a> at Lees Ferry shows periods of below and above average annual flow (approximately 14.8 maf). The most recent drought for the 2000-2015 period (indicated by the brown shaded area) was the driest 16-year period in the past 100 years and one of the driest 16-year periods in the past 1,200 years. The graphic also depicts how during the early part of the 1900s, which corresponds to the period of reference used to set the apportionments for the Upper and Lower Basins in the <a href="http://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g1000/pdfiles/crcompct.pdf" target="_blank">1922 Colorado River Compact</a>, was an unusually wet period (indicated by the green shaded area). At the time the 1922 Colorado River Compact went into effect, the average annual inflow at Lees Ferry was approximately 18.0 maf.

<p>Historical observations are extended by a <a href="{{baseUrl}}/treeringdata/index.html" target="_blank">tree-ring reconstruction</a> of streamflow going back approximately 1,200 years, as estimated by Meko et al. (2007). Because trees grow less during dry years and more during wet years, tree-ring cores can be used to estimate historical streamflow conditions going back many centuries. Tree-ring core samples were collected from locations throughout the Upper Basin to estimate historical natural flow. These estimates were validated using the observed natural flow record developed by Reclamation.
