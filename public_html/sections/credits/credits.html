        <p>Historically, communication, cooperation, and collaboration have been keys to successfully addressing challenges in the Colorado River basin. Western water managers are today taking proactive measures at the local, state and regional levels.
</p>
        
        <p>In the Colorado River Basin, the Bureau of Reclamation is undertaking proactive voluntary actions to increase reservoir elevations at Lake Powell and Lake Mead to reduce the probability of reaching critical reservoir elevations. Two of the actions involve voluntary programs to explore reductions in water use.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>System Conservation Pilot Program</strong> will test the effectiveness of voluntary, compensated reductions in water use resulting from conservation activities. The Program makes $11 million available for voluntary pilot projects that create “system water” -- water that remains in Lake Powell or Lake Mead for the benefit of all users. Colorado River water users in both the Upper and Lower basins and in Mexico are eligible to participate in the program.
</p>
		<p>The <strong>Lower Colorado River Basin Drought Contingency Planning Program</strong> stems from an agreement among the lower basin states of Arizona, California and Nevada and water agencies in those states to implement voluntary programs to create conserved water and help offset impacts of the on-going drought. Its goal is to generate 740,000 acre-feet of water to benefit Lake Mead elevation by 2017 through reducing use, creating <a href="" target="_blank">Intentionally Created Surplus</a>, and improving  operational efficiency. The agreement has a further goal to create 1.5 to 3.0 maf of water to benefit Lake Mead elevation by 2019.</p>
