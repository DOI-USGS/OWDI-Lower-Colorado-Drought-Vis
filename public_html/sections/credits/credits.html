        <p>Historically, communication, cooperation, and collaboration have been keys to successfully addressing challenges in the Colorado River Basin. Western water managers are today taking proactive measures at the local, state, and regional levels.
</p>
        
        <p>In the Colorado River Basin, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation is undertaking proactive voluntary actions to increase reservoir elevations at Lake Powell and Lake Mead to reduce the probability of reaching critical reservoir elevations. Two of the actions involve voluntary programs to explore reductions in water use.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>System Conservation Pilot Program</strong> will test the effectiveness of voluntary, compensated reductions in water use resulting from conservation activities. The Program makes $11 million available for voluntary pilot projects that create “system water” -- water that remains in Lake Powell or Lake Mead for the benefit of all users. Colorado River water users in both the Upper and Lower basins and in Mexico are eligible to participate in the program.
</p>
		<p>The <strong>Lower Colorado River Basin Drought Contingency Planning Program</strong> stems from an agreement among the lower basin states of Arizona, California and Nevada and water agencies in those states to implement voluntary programs to create conserved water and help offset impacts of the on-going drought. Its goal is to generate 740,000 acre-feet of water to benefit Lake Mead elevation by 2017 through reducing use, creating <a href="" target="_blank">Intentionally Created Surplus</a>, and improving  operational efficiency. The agreement has a further goal to create 1.5 to 3.0 maf of water to benefit Lake Mead elevation by 2019.</p>
		
	<p>The <strong>Colorado River Interim Guidelines for Lower Basin Shortages and Coordinated Operations for Lake Powell and Lake Mead</strong> (referred to as the Interim Guidelines or just Guidelines) were adopted in December 2007 and provide a framework for the coordinated operations of Lakes Powell and Mead through a full range of hydrologic conditions – from surplus to drought.  Prior to these Guidelines, it was not clear when a shortage would be declared, nor how much reduction the Lower Basin would face should shortage be declared.
</p>
	<p>The Interim Guidelines encourage efficient use and management of Colorado River water through a mechanism called Intentionally Created Surplus (ICS). The term ICS refers to a quantity of surplus water the Secretary may make available for release under Article II(B)(2) of the Consolidated Decree of the United States Supreme Court in Arizona v California, 547 U.S. 150 (2006). At end-of-year 2014, 840,000 acre-feet of total ICS was in Lake Mead.
</p>
	<p>Mexico’s water deliveries are not affected by the 2007 Interim Guidelines; however, under Minute 319 (see below), Mexico will share in reductions for an interim 5-year period from 2013-2018.
</p>
	<p>In November 2012, the United States and Mexico reached agreement on <strong>Minute 319</strong> to the 1944 Water Treaty; the Minute is a five-year agreement which provides for a series of joint cooperative actions between the United States and Mexico. Elements of the agreement include establishing proactive basin operations by applying water delivery reductions when Lake Mead reservoir conditions are low to deter more severe reductions in the future; and establishing a program of Intentionally Created Mexican Allocation whereby Mexico could temporarily reduce its order of Colorado River water, allowing that water to be delivered to Mexico in the future.
