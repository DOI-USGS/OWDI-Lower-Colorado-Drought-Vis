    	<p>The Colorado River basin is divided into upper and lower basins. The upper basin spans the states of Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah. The lower basin spans Nevada, Arizona and California. The River also supplies water to the northern portion of the country of Mexico.
</p>
			<p>Precipitation, primarily in the form of snow, falls on the Rocky Mountains, melts and replenishes Colorado River basin reservoirs. Colorado River basin reservoirs provide water for both upper and lower basins.</p>
            
            <p>The lower Colorado River basin is much drier than the upper basin, thus depends on deliveries from the upper basin for most of its Colorado River water.
