        <p>The pictogram above depicts the elevation range (from approximately 1,200 to 1,229 feet) and annual water deliveries in the Lower Basin when Lake Mead is operating in a Flood Control Surplus Condition. Blue boxes represent delivery to states (not to specific locations within states). When in flood control, Lake Mead’s operations are coordinated with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, pursuant to the 1984 Field Working Agreement between Reclamation and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. </p>
        
        <p>The operating condition of Lake Mead for the upcoming year is determined by the projected January 1 elevation from Reclamation’s August 24-Month Study, consistent with the <a href="http://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/programs/strategies.html" target="_blank">2007 Interim Guidelines</a> and as reported in the <a href="http://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g4000/aop/AOP15.pdf" target="_blank">Annual Operating Plan for Colorado River Reservoirs (AOP)</a>. The 2007 Interim Guidelines, adopted in December 2007 and in effect for an interim period through 2026, provide an objective methodology for determining the operating conditions and annual releases from Lake Powell and Lake Mead throughout the full range of reservoir operations, including low reservoir conditions. The 2007 Interim Guidelines also include criteria for implementing shortage and surplus conditions in the Lower Colorado River Basin.</p>
