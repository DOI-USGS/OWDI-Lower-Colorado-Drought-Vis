		<p>The annual <a href="http://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g4000/wtraccttypes.html" target="_blank">Water Accounting Report</a> tabulates measured diversions, measured and unmeasured returns and consumptive use of each user taking water from the Lower Colorado River.</p>
		<p>This pictogram depicts the average use by water user for the last five years. Each blue block represents 100,000 acre feet.</p>
		<p>Based on <a href="http://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/programs/strategies.html" target="_blank">Colorado River Interim Guidelines</a> for Lower Basin Shortages and the Coordinated Operations for Lake Powell and Lake Mead signed in 2007, every year on January 1, the Secretary of Interior provides a report describing the projected plan of operation for the coming year.</p>

		<p>The Operation of Lake Mead determined by this plan can be Normal, Surplus or Shortage Level 1, 2, or 3 based upon availability of 7.5 million acre feet of water to satisfy the consumptive use <a href="http://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g4000/wtrcontracts.html" target="_blank">contracts</a>. Ultimately, the water elevation of Lake Mead determines shortage conditions.</p>
                <p>These <a href="http://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/programs/strategies/documents.html" target="_blank">guidelines</a> allow the Secretary to better manage and operate the key Colorado River reservoirs and provide water users and managers a greater degree of certainty with respect to the amount of annual water deliveries in future years, particularly under drought and low reservoir conditions.</p>

                <p>As water elevation in Lake Mead changes, the <a href="http://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/programs/strategies/RecordofDecision.pdf" target="_blank">annual allocation</a> to water users also changes.

		<p>A "Normal Condition" exists when Lake Mead is at an elevation sufficient (between 1075 and 1145 feet) to satisfy the 7.5 million acre feet (MAF) consumptive use needs for the Lower Basin states.</p>

		<p>A "Shortage Condition" exists when the Secretary determines that there is not enough mainstream water available to satisfy the water use needs. (below 1075 feet).</p>
		<p>Shortage tier 1 (when water levels are between 1075 and 1050 feet), delivery reductions are: Nevada 13,000 MAF; Arizona 320,000 MAF; and Mexico 50,000 MAF.</p>
