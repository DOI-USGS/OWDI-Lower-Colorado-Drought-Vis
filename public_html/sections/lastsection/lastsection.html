        <p><i>Access to water data across states and agencies is difficult because it is collected by hundreds of organizations with no common infrastructure.</i> -- Al Rea, USGS
</p>
		<p>Improving access to data and enabling open exchange of water information are vital actions required to identify existing water resources issues and develop sustainable future solutions, particularly in the face of climate change and extraordinary drought. To address this challenge, the <a href="http://acwi.gov/spatial/owdi/" target="_blank">Open Water Data Initiative</a> is aimed at integrating fragmented water information that is already being collected by different agencies at several levels of government into a connected, national water data framework.
</p>
		<p>The Open Water Data Initiative will seek to improve the Open Water Web. The diagram  below summarizes the components of the this web of open water data, processing, and cataloging services
