		<p> Since 2000, the upper Colorado River basin has experienced the 15 driest years in over 100 years of historical recorded flows (Bureau of Reclamation), and one of the most severe droughts in the last 1200 years (Meko et al. 2012). </p>
        <p>90% of the total basin water supply for both the upper and lower Colorado River basins comes from the upper basin (Bureau of Reclamation), so a drought in the upper basin has a significant impact on the lower basin. Of water supply from the upper basin, about 50% of streamflow comes from groundwater (Rumsey et al. 2015) </p>

        <p> The impact of drought is also apparent in surface water. Streamflow in the Colorado River reflects drought conditions.

			<p>Historical natural flow illustrates how streamflow responds to drought in the Colorado River basin. The plot above shows estimated <i>natural flow</i> at Lee’s Ferry, Arizona. <i>Natural flow</i> is the flow that would have occurred without human impacts such as reservoirs and diversions. Lee’s Ferry is one of the uppermost stream gage locations in the Lower Colorado River Basin and is used as a proxy for water entering the Lower Basin via the Colorado River. These data show the 2000-2014 drought was the worst in the 20th century (and one of the worst 15-year periods in the last 1000 years). 
			</p>
			<p>Historical observations are extended by a tree-ring reconstruction of streamflow going back approximately 1200 years, estimated by Meko et al. (2012). Because trees grow less during drought, tree ring cores can be used to estimate historical streamflow conditions going back many centuries. Tree ring samples were collected from locations throughout the upper basin to estimate historical, natural flow; and were validated using observed streamflow data.
