		<p> Since 2000, the upper Colorado River Basin has experienced the 15 driest years in over 100 years of historical recorded flows and one of the most severe droughts in the last 1200 years. </p>
        <p>90% of the total basin water supply for both the Upper and Lower Basins comes from the Upper Basin, so a drought in the Upper Basin has a significant impact on the Lower Basin. Of water supply from the Upper Basin, about 50% of streamflow comes from groundwater.</p>

			<p>Historical natural flow illustrates how streamflow responds to drought in the Colorado River Basin. The plot above shows estimated <i>natural flow</i> at Lees Ferry, Arizona. <i>Natural flow</i> is the flow that would have occurred without human impacts such as reservoirs and upstream diversions. Lees Ferry is one of the uppermost stream gage locations in the Lower Colorado River Basin and is used as a proxy for water entering the Lower Basin via the Colorado River.
			</p>
			<p>Here, 15-year average natural flow at Lees Ferry shows periods of below and above average flow.The most recent, 2000-2014 drought (indicated by brown bar) was the worst in the 20th century (and one of the worst 15-year periods in the last 1000 years). The early part of the 20th century was particularly wet (indicated by green bar), and corresponds to the period of reference used to set water allocations to states.
			</p>
			<p>Historical observations are extended by a tree-ring reconstruction of streamflow going back approximately 1200 years, estimated by Meko et al. (2012). Because trees grow less during drought, tree ring cores can be used to estimate historical streamflow conditions going back many centuries. Tree ring samples were collected from locations throughout the upper basin to estimate historical, natural flow; and were validated using observed streamflow data.
