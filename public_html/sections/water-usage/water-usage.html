      <p>Since the early 1900â€™s, water use in the Colorado River Basin has increased while water supply has, on average, decreased. When the <a href="http://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g1000/pdfiles/crcompct.pdf" target="_blank">1922 Colorado River Compact</a> was completed and the allocations for Upper Basin and Lower Basin were developed, the average annual natural flow in the Upper Basin was about 18.0 MAF; when the 1944 U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty was completed, the average annual natural flow in the Upper Basin was about 16.3 MAF. Through water year 2012, the average annual natural inflow in the Upper Basin is about 14.8 MAF (Bureau of Reclamation, 2015).</p>
      
      <p>While the average annual inflow has decreased, the water balance in the Colorado River system is operating on increasingly close margins, and it now appears that the Colorado River system is over-allocated (Bureau of Reclamation, 2012). The storage capacity available on the Colorado River system has allowed it to meet water demands during this sustained, 16-year drought. However, water use during the drought has exceeded supplies into the system, drawing down the stored reserves.</p>
      
      <p>This trend of decreased water supply, coupled with increased water demand, emphasizes the need for all water users to proactively work together to reduce the strain of this tightening water budget.

        When water use is greater than supply, water storage is decreased as can be seen in reduced levels in reservoirs in the <a href="http://www.usbr.gov/uc/wcao/water/basin/tc_cr.html" target="_blank">Upper Basin</a> and <a href="http://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g4000/hourly/hourly.html" target="_blank">Lower Basin</a>.

      <p>Trends in water supply and water used from the Colorado River are shown above. When water use exceeds the water supplied, water reserves are reduced. Over the past 30 years, average water supply and average water use have been about equal- under these conditions, reservoirs are much slower to be replenished. Water supply and use data above are estimated by the Bureau of Reclamation using water accounting information, U.S. Geological Survey <a href="http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/wys_rpt/?site_no=09380000&agency_cd=USGS" target="_blank">stream gage data</a>, and other sources. </p>
      <p>
        1. Here, <strong> <em>water use</em> </strong> represents the sum of water withdrawn from the Colorado River and used for various purposes, as estimated by the Bureau of Reclamation. Although some water is withdrawn from the river and returned downstream, the red line above represents only water permanently removed from the Basin. Other methods of estimating use that account for withdrawals of surface and groundwater, and incorporate water that is used and returned to the stream, are made by the U.S. Geological Survey.
