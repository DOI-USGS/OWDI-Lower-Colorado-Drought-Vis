  <p>In the photo slider above, the change in Lake Mead’s surface area can be seen from the pre-drought conditions in 1999 to the current drought conditions as of 2014. The red area that emerges in the photo slide above represents the loss in the reservoir’s surface area as Lake Mead’s elevation has declined. Water surface area extent maps are based on <a href="http://landsat.usgs.gov/" target="_blank">U.S. Geological Survey Landsat</a> surface reflectance-corrected images acquired in the month of June in 1999 and 2014. For both composites, two Landsat images acquired within 16 days of each other have been merged to generate cloud-free composites suitable for measurement and change comparison.

  <p>Since 2001, Lake Mead’s elevation dropped from 1,196 to 1,075 feet by June 2015 (a decline of 121 feet). As the upper photo slider shows, the decline in the reservoir elevation during this time has exposed a white band of mineralized rock around the shoreline. The declining reservoir level has also exposed Hoover Dam’s four intake towers, two on the right side and two on the left side of the photo slider. Water from the reservoir flows through these intake towers at specified release volumes to meet downstream water demands in Arizona, California, Nevada, and Mexico, while producing hydropower as water flows through Hoover Dam’s 17 hydroelectric turbines.	</p>
  <div id="beforeAfter01HiddenContent" class="hiddenContent">
  <p>The lower photos show the conditions of Lake Mead and the upstream face of Hoover Dam in 2001 at elevation 1,196 feet (left photo) and the conditions in June 2015 at elevation 1,075 feet (center photo). The lower photos also show the Nevada spillway in the bottom right corner of the photos. There are two spillways at Hoover Dam, one on the Nevada side and one on the Arizona side of the dam. At higher reservoir levels, spillways would be use to bypass flow around the Hoover Dam powerplant to prevent water from overtopping the dam. When water reaches the top of the spillway drum gates, it flows into the spillways, bypassing the dam via a series of tunnels and re-entering the river channel below the dam.	</p>
  <p>Every 1-foot drop in the elevation of Lake Mead reduces Hoover Dam’s powerplant capacity by approximately 5.7 megawatts (Reclamation estimate, as reported in Illia, 2010).  Since Lake Mead was last full in 2000, Hoover Dam’s powerplant capacity has fallen from 2,074 to 1,563 megawatts (as of August 2015). Reclamation has mitigated some of this impact by replacing traditional turbines with “wide-head” turbines, which are capable of generating more efficiently at lower reservoir levels, and making significant efficiency improvements to the powerplant (Kuckro, 2014).	</p>
  <p>At Lake Powell, risk to the Glen Canyon Dam powerplant is related to declining reservoir levels and the potential for loss of generating capacity below elevation 3,490 feet. Based on Reclamation analysis conducted in August 2015, the earliest this is projected to occur is 2019 (about a 5 percent chance of occurring). Since Lake Powell finished filling in 1980, its water surface elevation has fallen to as low as elevation 3,555 feet (33 percent of capacity) in April 2005, approximately 65 feet above minimum power pool.</p>

  <p>The photo slider above shows Hemenway Harbor, located the southwestern portion of Lake Mead, with the location of Las Vegas Marina at elevation 1,152 feet in January 2003, and the new location of Las Vegas Marina at elevation 1,078 feet in May 2015. The photos also depict the increased exposure of Lake Mead’s shoreline and the emergence of the Boulder Islands, located on the right side of the photo, as the reservoir elevation declined.	</p>
  <p> Lake Mead’s declining reservoir elevation has impacted marinas and boat launching facilities at the Lake Mead National Recreation Area, requiring the relocation of marinas and the extension of boat ramps to keep recreational facilities open. To continue to provide boat access as reservoir levels have declined, the National Park Service, responsible for Lake Mead National Recreation Area, has been <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2010/11/01/20101101lake-mead-water-level-down.html" target="_blank">extending boat ramps since 2002</a> and <a href="http://bouldercityreview.com/sections/news/lake-meadhoover-dam/lake-mead%E2%80%99s-level-rises-slightly.html" target="_blank">planned to spend $5 million extending ramps in 2015</a>. Additional recreational impacts not shown in these photos include: In 2007, the Overton Beach marina became inoperable and facilities from Overton Beach were moved to two other marinas, Callville Bay and Temple Bar, located in Boulder Canyon and Temple Basin areas of Lake Mead, respectively. In 2008, Lake Mead Marina was moved from the location it had occupied since the 1960s to its current location in Hemenway Harbor.</p>
