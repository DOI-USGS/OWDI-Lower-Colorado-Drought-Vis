  <p><strong>Hoover Dam Pre-Sedimentation Tank</strong>, located on Boulder Island in Lake Mead. Also called the Batch Plant or Water Clarifying Tank, the structure filtered water for washing gravel used in concrete during the construction of Hoover Dam. At one time about 80’ under water, the tank is approximately 110 feet in diameter, its walls rising 15 feet, with the elevation of the top of the tank at 1125’. It submerged during the filling of Lake Mead during the 1930s, and resurfaced in 2004 as lake levels fell. </p>
  
  <p>Photos on the lower left and center show the tank under construction, looking northwest. Top photos were taken: (1) Left - July 2007, with the lake elevation at 1126’; (2) Right - May 2015, with the lake elevation at 1078’. Photo on the lower right shows Boulder Island in the foreground, with the tank located on the right side of the island; Lake Mead Marina is in the background. <a href="http://www.missionscuba.com/dive-sites_batch-plant.html" target="_blank">Pre-Sedimentation Tank</a>.

	<p><strong>Declining water elevations have affected recreation at Lake Mead, with boat ramps being extended and marinas being moved to deeper water.</strong> The National Park service, responsible for Lake Mead National Recreation Area, has been extending boat ramps since 2001, and planned to spend $5 million extending ramps in 2015. In 2008, Lake Mead Marina was moved from the location it had occupied since the 1960s. In 2007, another lake marina at Overton Beach split to join two other nearby marinas (Callville Bay Marina and the Temple Bar Marina). 
	</p>
	<p>Photos above show the southwestern portion of Lake Mead known as Hemenway Harbor. Left photo shows Las Vegas Marina in January 2003, with the lake at elevation 1152’. Boulder islands are located on the right side of the photo; right photo shows Las Vegas Marina in May 2015, at its new location and with the lake at elevation 1078’; Boulder Islands are in the center of the photo. </p>
