  <p>Change in surface area of Lake Mead between 1999 pre-drought conditions and 2014 drought conditions. Red area shown on the right image is surface area loss. Surface water extent maps are based on <a href="http://landsat.usgs.gov/" target="_blank">U.S. Geological Survey Landsat</a> surface reflectance-corrected images acquired in the month of June. For 1999 and 2014, two Landsat images acquired within 16 days of each other have been merged to generate cloud-free composites suitable for measurement and change comparison.

  <p><strong>Hoover Dam Pre-Sedimentation Tank</strong>, located on Boulder Island in Lake Mead. Also called the Batch Plant or Water Clarifying Tank, the structure filtered water for washing gravel used in concrete during the construction of Hoover Dam. At one time about 80’ under water, the tank is approximately 110 feet in diameter, its walls rising 15 feet, with the elevation of the top of the tank at 1125’. It submerged during the filling of Lake Mead during the 1930s, and resurfaced in 2004 as lake levels fell. </p>
  
  <p>Lake elevation at 1126’ in July 2007 (left) and at 1078' in May 2015 (right) are shown in the upper photo. Tank construction, looking northwest, is shown in the lower left and lower center photos. Photo on the lower right shows Boulder Island in the foreground, with the tank located on the right side of the island; Lake Mead Marina is in the background.

  	<p><strong>In July 2015, Lake Mead elevation dropped to 1075’, down 137 feet from its elevation of 1212’ during non-drought conditions of 1999</strong>. Lower left and center photos show the upstream face of Hoover Dam and Lake Mead in the year 2003, with the Lake at elevation 1196’ (left) and the upstream face of Hoover Dam and Lake Mead in June 2015, with the Lake at elevation 1078’ (center).
	</p>
	<p>Photos on the bottom show the weir for the Dam’s Nevada <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoover_Dam#Spillways" target="_blank">spillway</a>. There are two spillways at the Dam, one on Arizona side and one on the Nevada side. The spillways are used to prevent the Dam from overtopping - when water reaches a certain elevation, it flows over the weirs and into the spillways, bypassing the Dam via a series of tunnels and re-entering the river channel below the Dam. Left bottom photo was taken in November 2003, with the Lake at elevation 1196’; right bottom photo was taken in May 2015, with the Lake at elevation 1078’. </p>

	<p><strong>Declining water elevations have affected recreation at Lake Mead, with boat ramps being extended and marinas being moved to deeper water.</strong> The National Park Service, responsible for Lake Mead National Recreation Area, has been extending boat ramps since 2001, and planned to spend $5 million extending ramps in 2015. In 2008, Lake Mead Marina was moved from the location it had occupied since the 1960s. In 2007, another lake marina at Overton Beach split to join two other nearby marinas (Callville Bay Marina and the Temple Bar Marina).
	</p>
	<p>Photos above show the southwestern portion of Lake Mead known as Hemenway Harbor. Left photo shows Las Vegas Marina in January 2003, with the lake at elevation 1152’. Boulder Islands are located on the right side of the photo; right photo shows Las Vegas Marina in May 2015, at its new location and with the lake at elevation 1078’; Boulder Islands are in the center of the photo. </p>
