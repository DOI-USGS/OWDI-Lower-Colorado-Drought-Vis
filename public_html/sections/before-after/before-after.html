    <p>Declines in water surface elevation impact use of stored water. A 1 foot drop in the elevation of Lake Mead reduces power generation capacity by 5.7 megawatts (Bureau of Reclamation), and a 10 foot drop in elevation costs the National Park Service $2.1 million to extend boat ramps (NPS Lake Mead National Recreation Area fact sheet, 2014). </p>

  <p>Change in surface area of Lake Mead between 1999 pre-drought conditions and 2014 drought conditions. Red area shown on the right image is surface area loss. Surface water extent maps are based on <a href="http://landsat.usgs.gov/" target="_blank">U.S. Geological Survey Landsat</a> surface reflectance-corrected images acquired in the month of June. For 1999 and 2014, two Landsat images acquired within 16 days of each other have been merged to generate cloud-free composites suitable for measurement and change comparison.

  <p><strong>Hoover Dam Pre-Sedimentation Tank</strong>, located on Boulder Islands in Lake Mead. Also called the Batch Plant or Water Clarifying Tank, this structure filtered water for washing gravel used in concrete during the construction of Hoover Dam. At an elevation at its top of 1125 feet, the tank is approximately 110 feet in diameter, its walls rising 15 feet, with the elevation of the top of the tank at 1125’. It submerged during the filling of Lake Mead during the 1930s, and was at one time about 80 feet under water. The tank resurfaced in 2004 as lake levels fell. </p>
  
  <p>Lake elevation at 1126 feet in July 2007 (left) and at 1078 feet in May 2015 (right) are shown in the upper photo. Tank construction, looking northwest, is shown in the lower left and lower center photos. The photo on the lower right shows Boulder Islands in the foreground, with the tank located on the right side of the island; Lake Mead Marina is in the background.

  	<p><strong>In July 2015, Lake Mead water surface elevation dropped to 1075 feet, a decrease of 137 feet from its elevation of 1212 feet during the non-drought conditions of 1999</strong>. The lower left and center photos show the upstream face of Hoover Dam and Lake Mead in 2003, with the lake at elevation at 1196 feet (left) and the upstream face of Hoover Dam and Lake Mead in June 2015, with the lake at elevation 1078 feet (center).

	<p>The photos on the bottom show the weir for the Dam’s Nevada <a href="http://www.usbr.gov/lc/hooverdam/History/essays/spillways.html" target="_blank">spillway</a>. There are two spillways at Hoover Dam, one on the Arizona side and one on the Nevada side. The spillways are used to prevent the Dam from overtopping during high water periods. When water reaches the top of the spillway drum gates, it flows into the spillways, bypassing the dam via a series of tunnels and re-entering the river channel below the dam.</p>

	<p><strong>Declining water elevations during the drought have affected recreation at Lake Mead, requiring extensions of boat ramps and relocation of and marinas to deeper water.</strong> The National Park Service, responsible for Lake Mead National Recreation Area, has been extending boat ramps since 2001, and planned to spend $5 million extending ramps in 2015. In 2008, Lake Mead Marina was moved to deeper water from the location it had occupied since the 1960s. In 2007, another lake marina at Overton Beach was split to join two other nearby marinas (Callville Bay Marina and Temple Bar Marina).

	<p>The photos above show the southwestern portion of Lake Mead known as Hemenway Harbor. The left photo shows Las Vegas Marina in January 2003, with the lake elevation at 1152 feet. Boulder Islands are located on the right side of the photo; the right photo shows Las Vegas Marina in May 2015, at its new location and with the lake at elevation 1078’; Boulder Islands are in the center of the photo. </p>
