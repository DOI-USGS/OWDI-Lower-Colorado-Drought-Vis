		<p>Basin-wide system storage totals about 60 maf, approximately four times the average annual inflow in the Upper Basin (14.8 maf). The Basinâ€™s two largest reservoirs, Lake Powell and Lake Mead, combine for about 50 maf of storage, approximately 83 percent of the total system storage. This large storage capacity creates a buffer against year-to-year hydrologic variability and longer-term drought periods by allowing the storage of excess water during wet years and the use of water from storage during dry years. </p>
		<p>It is this large amount of Basin-wide storage that has allowed Reclamation to continue to meet water delivery requirements during the current drought period. It should be noted, however, that headwater reaches in the Upper Basin sometimes experience localized shortages due to insufficient in-stream flows during dry years.</p>
