		<p>Colorado River basin system storage totals about 60 maf, 4 times the system’s average annual inflow.  The Basin’s two largest reservoirs, Lake Powell and Lake Mead, combine for about 50 maf of storage, or 83 percent of the total system storage capacity </p>
		<p>This large storage capacity creates a buffer to year-to-year hydrologic variability by allowing the storage of additional water during wet years and the use of water from storage to make deliveries during dry years. </p>
		<p>The system is working as designed; to date, a Lower Basin Shortage has never been determined. </p>
