		<p>Colorado River Basin system storage totals about 60 million acre feet (MAF), four times the system’s average annual inflow.  This means that it would take about four years to fill all of the system storage reservoirs from the bottom up. The last time Lake Mead was at full capacity was in 1998. </p>
		<p>The Basin’s two largest reservoirs, Lake Powell and Lake Mead, combine for about 50 MAF of storage, or 83% of the total system storage capacity. This large storage capacity creates a buffer from year-to-year hydrologic variability by allowing the storage of additional water during wet years, and the use of water from storage during dry years.</p>
		<p>The system is working as designed: to date, shortages in the Lower Basin have not been severe enough to cause decrease in water allocations.</p>
