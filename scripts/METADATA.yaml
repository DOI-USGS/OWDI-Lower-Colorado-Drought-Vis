  methods: "[water_account](R/water_account.R) is used to create the Colorado River Basin Boundary. For the Lower Basin, [lc_huc_simp-clean ](../src_data/CO_WBD/lc_huc_simp-clean.shp) is created from [LC_HUCs_wMexico_20140820](../src_data/CO_WBD/LC_UC_HUCs_wMexico_20140820.shp). This file was created as follows:
1. Started with 12-digit, 6th level HUCs from [NRCS](http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/national/water/watersheds/?cid=nrcs143_021630)
1. HU2 was selected to include Name = Lower Colorado Region and Name = Upper Colorado Region. 
1. From that remaining data set, HU4 was used to exclude Name = Sonora. 
1. From that remaining data set, HU10 was used to exclude HUC10 = 1503010805 and HUC10 = 1503010806 (which is the most south-easterly portion of HU4, Name = Lower Colorado)
See [LC_HUCs_wMexico_20140820.shp.xml](../src_data/CO_WBD/LC_UC_HUCs_wMexico_20140820.shp.xml) for more details.
For the Upper Basin boundary, the Upper Colorado Region from the [NRCS HUC data](http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/national/water/watersheds/?cid=nrcs143_021630) was used."

  description:
  methods: "The service areas for Lower Colorado contractors were provided by Reclamation's [Water Administration Group](http://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g4000/contracts/entitlements.html). These data are considered **provisional** by Reclamation. 

[LC_Contracts_update2014](../src_data/LCContractSvcAreas) contain the contract service Areas for water contracts in the Lower Colorado Region. This database was developed based on the exisitng water contracts between Reclamation and the individual water users on the River. The Service Areas of present perfected rights are also included in this database.

[water_account](R/water_account.R) use these boundaries to depict where use is occuring in the Lower Basin."

  title: Lower Basin Water Accounting Data
  description:
  methods: "The Bureau of Reclamation Lower Colorado River Water Accounting group produces annual Water Accounting Reports, which tabulate the measured diversions, measured returns, and consumptive use of each user taking water from the Lower Colorado River. The published reports are available [online](http://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g4000/wtracct.html#decree) in pdf format. For this project, the [DecreeAccting_2000_2013_orig.xlsx](../src_data/LBDecreeAccounting/DecreeAccting_2000_2013_orig.xlsx) file was provided by the Water Accounting group. The Excel file was then manually edited to make processing easier and saved as [DecreeAccting_2000_2013.xlsx](../src_data/LBDecreeAccounting/DecreeAccting_2000_2013.xlsx). These changes are documented [here](../src_data/LBDecreeAccounting/).

Finally, [reformatDecreeData](R/reformatDecreeData.R) was used to create the [DecreeData.csv](../src_data/LBDecreeAccounting/DecreeData.csv) file from [DecreeAccting_2000_2013.xlsx](../src_data/LBDecreeAccounting/DecreeAccting_2000_2013.xlsx)."

  methods: "[PowellMeadFullHistorical.csv](../src_data/PowellMeadFullHistorical.csv) was provided by Reclamation. This file contains monthly historical data for Powell and Mead elevations and storage, since each reservoir began filling. [reformat_historical_storage_data](scripts/R/reformat_historical_storage_data.R) adds Powell and Mead storage together, filters to only end-of-December values, and creates [MeadPowellCombinedStorage.tsv](../src_data/MeadPowellCombinedStorage.tsv). The tsv file is used by XXX."
