Notes and Links
===============

This file simply contains notes and links needed for development of the lower colo viz.  I (@jhollist) put this together becuase I was having trouble finding everything in my emails and becasue my remote email access sends all links through a proxy thus rendering most of them useless.

Currently no real structure to this.
