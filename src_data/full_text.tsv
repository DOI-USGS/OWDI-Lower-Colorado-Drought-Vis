The Basin’s two largest reservoirs, Lake Powell and Lake Mead hold about 50 maf combined, approximately 83 percent of the total system storage capacity.

When the 1944 U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty was executed, the average annual natural flow in the Upper Basin was about 16.3 maf (1906-1944). The current average annual natural flow in the Upper Basin is about 14.8 maf (1906-2015). "waterUsage2	"As the average annual natural flow has decreased, the difference between water supply and water demand has narrowed and the Colorado River system has been operating on increasingly close margins. As a result of this decrease in natural flows and an increase in water use basin-wide, it now appears that the Colorado River system is over-allocated (Bureau of Reclamation, 2012)."waterUsage3	"Climate projections indicate more extreme conditions are possible, with longer, more severe wet and dry periods.

Since Lake Mead was last full in 2000, Hoover Dam’s powerplant capacity has fallen from 2,074 to 1,563 megawatts (as of August 2015). Reclamation has mitigated some of this impact by replacing traditional turbines with “wide-head” turbines, which are capable of generating more efficiently at lower reservoir levels, and making significant efficiency improvements to the powerplant. "beforeAfter6	"At Lake Powell, the generating capacity of the Glen Canyon Dam powerplant is put at risk by declining reservoir levels. Below elevation 3,490 feet, Glen Canyon Dam cannot generate power. Based on Reclamation analysis conducted in August 2015, the earliest this is projected to occur is 2019 (about a 5 percent chance of occurring).

Activities related to drought response include a system conservation program and drought contingency planning efforts in both basins. Additional ongoing activities are being conducted with stakeholders through the Basin Study Moving Forward process and with Native American Tribes through the Ten Tribes Partnership Tribal Water Study. Lastly, the implementation of Minute 319 and related binational discussions also underscore the importance of the partnership and continued collaboration between the United States and Mexico."credits2	"In 2014, an $11 million funding agreement for <a href=""http://www.usbr.gov/newsroom/newsrelease/detail.cfm?RecordID=48006"" target=""_blank"">Pilot System Conservation Program (PSCP)</strong></a> was executed among Reclamation, Central Arizona Water Conservation District (CAWCD), the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD), Denver Water (DW), and the Southern Nevada Water Authority (SNWA) (the Funding Partners). The PSCP establishes a mechanism for funding the creation of Colorado River system water through voluntary water conservation actions and reductions in water use beginning in 2015 and continuing through at least 2016.  The purpose of the PSCP is to explore and learn about the effectiveness of voluntary measures that could be used, when needed, to help maintain water levels in Lake Powell and Lake Mead above critical levels.  All water conserved as a result of the pilot program would be considered Colorado River system water.  Proposals under the PSCP have been received from potential program participants in both the Upper and Lower Basins, where execution of implementation agreements began in 2015 and is ongoing."credits3	"In Lower Basin drought contingency planning, Reclamation is working with Arizona, California, and Nevada to identify proactive steps to lower the risk of reaching critical elevations at Lake Mead.

Reclamation, MWD, SNWA, and CAWCD have agreed to take first steps to generate 0.740 maf of the additional water by the end of 2017. The MOU is an important step forward but a more comprehensive drought plan is currently being discussed with key water agencies in the Lower Basin."credits4	"In Upper Basin drought contingency planning, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming are pursuing a plan with three major components: 1) extended operations of the Colorado River Storage Project (CRSP) reservoirs, 2) voluntary demand management (e.g., fallowing or deficit irrigation), and 3) augmentation (primarily weather modification, such as cloud seeding).  Reclamation, in collaboration with the Upper Basin States, has conducted modeling that indicates extended operations of the upper CRSP reservoirs to move water to Lake Powell can significantly reduce the probability of Lake Powell falling below critical elevations.  Reclamation, in consultation with the Upper Basin States, is developing an extended operations plan and implementation agreement.  It is anticipated that these will be completed by the end of 2015."credits5	"In addition to the previously mentioned activities, Congress has provided authorization for additional funding through Reclamation for drought-related activities to increase Colorado River system water in Lake Mead, Lake Powell, and other Colorado River system reservoirs for the benefit of the system.
