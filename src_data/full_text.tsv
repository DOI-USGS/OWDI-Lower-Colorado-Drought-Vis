The Colorado River Basin is divided into Upper and Lower Basins at the Lee Ferry compact point located in northern Arizona. The Upper Basin spans portions of Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and northern Arizona, and the Lower Basin spans portions of Nevada, Arizona, California, and western New Mexico. The Colorado River also supplies water to portions of northwestern Mexico, in the states of Baja California and Sonora, and serves at least 22 Federally-recognized Native American Tribes and Communities located within the Basin."basinDivided2	"The Upper Colorado River Basin supplies most of the water for the Basin. Of the total water supply from the Upper Basin, about 50 percent of streamflow comes from baseflow (Rumsey et al., 2015). Most baseflow is water that originates as precipitation and snowmelt in the Rocky and Wasatch Mountains, replenishes local groundwater supplies, and resurfaces as streamflow that feeds Upper Basin reservoirs. The Lower Basin is arid with little tributary runoff reaching the mainstream of the Colorado River except during occasional rain events.  The Lower Basin is dependent upon managed use of the Colorado River system to make its land habitable and productive.  The importance of the Colorado River to the region it serves is underscored by the legal framework that governs its management."basinDivided3	"Within the Basin is an interconnected system of rivers, dams, reservoirs, and water diversions that provides water for uses such as agriculture, municipal and domestic use, hydropower, ecosystems, and recreation. Colorado River water is also delivered to areas that lie outside the BasinÕs hydrologic boundary, including southwestern California, the east side of the Front Range in Colorado, and the west side of the Wasatch Range in Utah."basinDivided4	"Resources and facilities within the Colorado River Basin are managed to accomplish their project goals in a manner fully consistent with applicable provisions of Federal law including the <a href=""http://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/pao/lawofrvr.html"" target=""_blank"">Law of the River</a> and other project-specific operational guidelines.

The ability to capture water during high flow years and to use this stored water in drier years has enabled Reclamation to meet resource needs throughout this drought period. Although the Basin is experiencing the worst 16-year drought in over 100 years of record, the system of reservoirs has provided multiple years of storage as designed and, throughout the drought, delivery commitments in both basins have been met."blueDragon2	"In addition to providing storage for regional water supply and facilitating water deliveries, the dams and reservoirs in the Colorado River system also provide flood control benefits, improve navigation, and allow for the generation of hydroelectric power. The construction of these facilities have allowed for the development adjacent or nearby water delivery systems and management supports ancillary benefits such as other economic, cultural, and ecologic services."blueDragon3	"In the Lower Basin, Hoover Dam was constructed pursuant to the 1928 Boulder Canyon Project Act (BCPA) for the purpose of controlling floods, improving navigation, regulating the riverÕs flow, providing for water storage and delivery, and for the generation of electrical energy. The BCPA and subsequent construction of Hoover Dam in 1935 allowed for the construction of the Imperial Diversion Dam in 1938, the last diversion dam on the Colorado River for United States water users located north of Yuma, Arizona. From its head works, water is diverted into the All-American Canal on the California side of the dam and into the Gila Gravity Main Canal on the Arizona side of the dam. These diversions provide water to the Gila Project, the Yuma Project, the Imperial Irrigation District, the Coachella Valley Water District, and the City of Yuma, and through Siphon Drop and Pilot Knob to the Northerly International Boundary (NIB) for diversion at Morelos Dam in Mexico."blueDragon4	"In 1938, Parker Dam was constructed to regulate water released from Hoover Dam and allowed for the construction of the W.P. Whitsett Intake Pumping Plant in 1940 and the Mark Wilmer Pumping Plant in 1993 (water diversions for the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California and Central Arizona Project, respectively). The construction of Davis Dam in 1953 provided additional regulation for water released from Hoover Dam. Water released from both of these facilities are made to satisfy beneficial use requirements of Lower Colorado River entitlement holders in the United States, deliver water to Mexico pursuant to the 1944 U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty, and to generate hydropower with these water releases."blueDragon5	"The graphic below depicts the major dams, reservoirs, and control structures of the Lower Colorado River."blueDragon6	Click here for PDF versionblueDragon7	USGS Texas Water Science Center AppblueDragon8	"To see realtime data and take a journey through major dams on the Lower Colorado River, click button below."mainMessageDirt	The western U.S. is experiencing an extended drought.dygraphsSection1	"Since 2000, the Colorado River Basin has experienced the driest 16-year period in over 100 years of historical natural flows (Bureau of Reclamation, 2015) and one of the most severe droughts in the last 1,200 years (Meko et al., 2007a and 2007b)."dygraphsSection2	"Bureau of Reclamation, 2015. <a href=""http://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g4000/NaturalFlow/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Colorado River Basin Natural Flow and Salt Data website</a>."dygraphsSection3	"Meko, D.M., et al. 2007a. <a href=""ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/paleo/treering/reconstructions/northamerica/usa/upper-colorado-flow2007.txt"" target=""_blank"">Upper Colorado River Flow Reconstruction</a>.

The current long-term average annual natural flow in the Upper Basin is about 14.8 maf (Bureau of Reclamation, 2015)."waterUsage2	"While the average annual natural flow has decreased since the early 1900s, the balance between water supply and water demand in the Colorado River system has been operating on increasingly close margins. As a result of this decrease in natural flows and an increase in water depletions basin-wide, it now appears that the Colorado River system is over-allocated (Bureau of Reclamation, 2012)."waterUsage3	"Climate projections indicate more extreme conditions are possible, with longer, more severe wet and dry periods.

The lower photos also show the Nevada spillway in the bottom right corner of the photos. There are two spillways at Hoover Dam, one on the Nevada side and one on the Arizona side of the dam. At higher reservoir levels, spillways would be use to bypass flow around the Hoover Dam powerplant to prevent water from overtopping the dam. When water reaches the top of the spillway drum gates, it flows into the spillways, bypassing the dam via a series of tunnels and re-entering the river channel below the dam."beforeAfter5	"Every 1-foot drop in the elevation of Lake Mead reduces Hoover DamÕs powerplant capacity by approximately 5.7 megawatts (Reclamation estimate, as reported in Illia, 2010).  Since Lake Mead was last full in 2000, Hoover DamÕs powerplant capacity has fallen from 2,074 to 1,563 megawatts (as of August 2015). Reclamation has mitigated some of this impact by replacing traditional turbines with Òwide-headÓ turbines, which are capable of generating more efficiently at lower reservoir levels, and making significant efficiency improvements to the powerplant (Kuckro, 2014)."beforeAfter6	"At Lake Powell, risk to the Glen Canyon Dam powerplant is related to declining reservoir levels and the potential for loss of generating capacity below elevation 3,490 feet. Based on Reclamation analysis conducted in August 2015, the earliest this is projected to occur is 2019 (about a 5 percent chance of occurring). Since Lake Powell finished filling in 1980, its water surface elevation has fallen to as low as elevation 3,555 feet (33 percent of capacity) in April 2005, approximately 65 feet above minimum power pool."beforeAfter7	"The photo slider above shows Hemenway Harbor, located the southwestern portion of Lake Mead, with the location of Las Vegas Marina at elevation 1,152 feet in January 2003, and the new location of Las Vegas Marina at elevation 1,078 feet in May 2015.

The PSCP establishes a mechanism for funding the creation of Colorado River system water through voluntary water conservation actions and reductions in water use beginning in 2015 and continuing through at least 2016.  The purpose of the PSCP is to explore and learn about the effectiveness of voluntary measures that could be used, when needed, to help maintain water levels in Lake Powell and Lake Mead above critical levels.  All water conserved as a result of the pilot program would be considered Colorado River system water.  Proposals under the PSCP have been received from potential program participants in both the Upper and Lower Basins, where execution of implementation agreements began in 2015 and is ongoing."credits3	"In Lower Basin drought contingency planning, Reclamation is working with Arizona, California, and Nevada to identify proactive steps to lower the risk of reaching critical elevations at Lake Mead.

Reclamation, in collaboration with the Upper Basin States, has conducted modeling that indicates extended operations of the upper CRSP reservoirs to move water to Lake Powell can significantly reduce the probability of Lake Powell falling below critical elevations.  Reclamation, in consultation with the Upper Basin States, is developing an extended operations plan and implementation agreement.
