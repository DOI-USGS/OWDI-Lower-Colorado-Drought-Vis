Source Data
===========

Pre-processed data and any intermediate data will find its way in here.  It will probably make sense to split this up by section and have the scripts checked in with the source data.  Look at this as the working directory and the target directory will be one within the public_html such that it is served up with the visualization.  Currently the spanish text is the same as the english, but swapping that file with the translation will fix this issue.
